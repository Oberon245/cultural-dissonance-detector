# Cultural Dissonance Detector

This repository contains simulation models and interpretive tools designed to identify and illustrate how modern science, under institutional and profit-driven constraints, often contributes to cognitive dissonance and systemic stress.

## Core Modules
- **Mechanism Integrity Evaluator (MTI)**: Tests claims against fundamental physics, chemistry, and biology.
- **Cultural Assumption Detector (CAD)**: Identifies false narratives mistaken for universal truths.
- **Dissonance Timeline Visualizer**: Traces the lag between scientific narrative and observable reality.

These tools aim to expose and reverse metacognitive lock—a systemic inability to self-correct—by providing simulations and pattern detection across historical datasets.

Built as part of the ANGEL Project.
