# Cultural Dissonance Detector

This project is part of the broader ANGEL Project initiative, which aims to bridge the gap between complex digital systems and human well-being. The Cultural Dissonance Detector (CDD) is a machine learning–based simulation tool that identifies patterns of cultural contradiction and stress in AI outputs or institutional discourse.

## Purpose

The detector simulates how a model or system responds when it encounters implicit cultural contradictions—statements or practices that appear normalized but conflict with empirical reality, scientific sustainability, or collective human thriving.

## Key Features

- **Dissonance Scoring**: Quantifies contradictions between profit-seeking, sustainability, and dignity-based values.
- **Validation Loop**: Tests AI and institutional outputs for embedded stress patterns, inconsistency, or maladaptive assumptions.
- **Ethical Signal Detection**: Flags narrative distortions that perpetuate economic or ecological harm under the guise of stability.

## Use Cases

- AI alignment research and interpretability
- Institutional reform simulations
- Evaluating educational, corporate, or governmental messaging
- Tools for psychologists, sociologists, and cognitive scientists

## Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for simulation and scoring logic  
- `data/`: Placeholder for test content (e.g. policy briefs, corporate statements)  
- `models/`: Optional future expansion for fine-tuned models  
- `results/`: Output from simulations  

## Next Steps

- Finalize and run the prototype notebook  
- Benchmark known contradictory narratives (e.g. greenwashing, military humanitarianism)  
- Validate the scoring framework for academic and real-world application
